![usages](https://github.com/YukkuriC/CreateCollectionBundles/blob/main/static/usages.png?raw=true)

# Current Contents

-   Carving pumpkins by extracting its seed
-   `Refined Storage` compat: extracting items inside network through:
    -   (normal & creative) controller blocks
    -   network transmitter/receiver blocks
    -   **NOTE:** due to some undefined behaviors, _inserting_ items into these blocks are not supported, only _extracting_ allowed

# Future Plans

-   [ ] supporting `AE2` network
-   [ ] supporting QIO network from `Mekanism`
-   [ ] custom registration API via `KubeJS`
-   [ ] porting to Fabric and other versions
